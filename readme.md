### STEALING UR FEELINGS

[https://stealingurfeelin.gs](https://stealingurfeelin.gs) :arrow_left: :arrow_left: :arrow_left: 

Meet the new AI that knows you better than you know yourself.

[*Stealing Ur Feelings*](https://stealingurfeelin.gs) is an augmented reality experience that reveals how your favorite apps can use facial emotion recognition technology to make decisions about your life, promote inequalities, and even destabilize American democracy. Using the AI techniques described in corporate patents, [*Stealing Ur Feelings*](https://stealingurfeelin.gs) learns your deepest secrets just by analyzing your face.

The project [premiered on the internet](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2019/09/23/introducing-stealing-ur-feelings-an-interactive-documentary-about-big-tech-ai-and-you/) on September 23, 2019.
