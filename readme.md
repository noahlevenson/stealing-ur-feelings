[https://stealingurfeelin.gs](https://stealingurfeelin.gs) :arrow_left: :arrow_left: :arrow_left: 

Meet the new AI that knows you better than you know yourself.

[*Stealing Ur Feelings*](https://stealingurfeelin.gs) is a deep learning-powered AR experience which analyzes your facial reactions to reveal the dangers of Big Tech's emotional surveillance programs. Using the AI techniques described in corporate patents, [*Stealing Ur Feelings*](https://stealingurfeelin.gs) learns your deepest secrets just by analyzing your face.

It [won the 2020 Webby Award](https://winners.webbyawards.com/2020/video/immersive-and-mixed-reality/documentary-immersive-and-mixed-reality/126432/stealing-ur-feelings) for Best Immersive Documentary.

The project [premiered on the internet](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2019/09/23/introducing-stealing-ur-feelings-an-interactive-documentary-about-big-tech-ai-and-you/) on September 23, 2019. 

It world premiered at the [2019 Tribeca Film Festival](https://www.tribecafilm.com/festival/archive/stealing-ur-feelings-2019) and was exhibited at the [Tate Modern](https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/tate-exchange/workshop/higher-resolution). It was profiled by the [Museum of the Moving Image](http://scienceandfilm.org/articles/3216/stealing-ur-feelings), [*Scientific American*](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/this-video-watches-you-back/), [*Engadget*](https://www.engadget.com/2019/05/02/stealing-ur-feelings-ar-film-facial-recognition-tribeca-2019-kanye-pizza/), [CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/stealing-ur-feelings-1.5362954), and many more; it made the front page of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21337863); [MIT selected it for inclusion in DocuBase](https://docubase.mit.edu/project/stealing-ur-feelings/), a curated database of people and projects transforming documentary in the digital age.

[*Stealing Ur Feelings*](https://stealingurfeelin.gs) was somewhat notoriously plagiarized by the *Financial Times;* this event was chronicled in an [article for *The American Prospect*](https://prospect.org/culture/stealing-ur-website-emotion-recognition-ai-financial-times/).

The project began life as an application for Mozilla's 2018 [awards for art and advocacy exploring artificial intelligence](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/06/04/mozilla-announces-225000-for-art-and-advocacy-exploring-artificial-intelligence/).

### :eyes: Tech notes
* **The code is a mess.** It required a lot of trial and error over many months just to figure out how to tell the story. Consequently, the version of [*Stealing Ur Feelings*](https://stealingurfeelin.gs) which premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival was programmed over 6 frantic weeks between March and April 2019. That version was so unoptimized that it simply wouldn't run on average hardware. Optimization began in June 2019, and there wasn't enough time to improve most of the earlier bad decisions. The indecipherable comments have been preserved.

* **Different versions of the project have used different computer vision engines.** Journalists often asked what emotion recognition models we used; the answer changed depending on the day they viewed the project. We built an excessively complicated custom engine on top of TensorFlow that wound up getting scrapped. At one point we managed to compile [Dlib](http://dlib.net/) for the browser via the WebAssembly toolchain, and we got its multithreaded facial landmark detector working with HTML5 canvas by mapping native pthreads to WebWorkers. You can see that experiment [here](https://github.com/noahlevenson/dlib-in-the-browser). The version of [*Stealing Ur Feelings*](https://stealingurfeelin.gs) published in September 2019 uses [face-api.js](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/).

* ***Stealing Ur Feelings* uses a custom system for frame-accurate video synchronization.** It's based on embedding encoded information in the overscan area of the video, a la [datacasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datacasting). The purely arithmetic  approaches to frame-accurate sync are interesting, but the effects of floating point approximation error means that none of them work at the level of precision we required.

* **On Chrome, *Stealing Ur Feelings* deploys a zero-copy hack using OffscreenCanvas to run the computer vision engine on a separate thread.** During development, Firefox's implementation of OffscreenCanvas was incomplete. The result is that [*Stealing Ur Feelings*](https://stealingurfeelin.gs) runs much smoother on Chrome. (Another result: there have been OffscreenCanvas regressions in Chrome stable releases which have caused [*Stealing Ur Feelings*](https://stealingurfeelin.gs) to segfault the browser.)

* **There's a secret physical installation mode.** At the Tribeca Film Festival premiere, [*Stealing Ur Feelings*](https://stealingurfeelin.gs) was installed under a big television hanging from the ceiling which broadcast the AI-extracted "secrets" of whoever was experiencing the project at that moment. The client and server to support this functionality are located in the [/installation](https://github.com/noahlevenson/stealing-ur-feelings/tree/master/final/installation) directory. For the premiere, we tuned the political bias algorithm to classify absolutely everyone as a far-right conservative Republican. It was fun to watch journalists freak out when their secret political affiliation was revealed on the jumbotron.
